      <p>My interest in interactive data visualizations started in college. However, at that time the technology available was limited enough that it was difficult to share these visualizations with a mass audience. I realized shortly after learning about D3.js that it was what I had been looking for. Through various hackathons, contests and other challenges, I have had the opportunity to visualize data using D3.js. This is a timeline of that work.</p> <p>Click on a month to get information about was worked on in that month. </p>
